## What's This Project?
This is one of my first full C/C++ programs, in order to create a calculator with similar capabilities to that of the TI-84 Plus CE calculator within the console.

## Why did I make it?
It's one primarily made to test how I'm going to make a collaborative project in my CS120 class, though it's also something that could be neat and fun to develop.  
(and maybe go on my portfolio, I dunno tho)
